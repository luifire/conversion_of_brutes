# Conversion of Brutes

A software project with a team of five developers / B.Sc. computer science students.<br>
It is an Age of Empires themed game, where instead of building a base, you only get priests and hordes
of brutes which attack you.
Convert them and reattack in order to win all other bases.<br><br><br>

As the game is too big for GitHub, the rest of the files can be found here<br>
